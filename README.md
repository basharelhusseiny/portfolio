# Portfolio

This website is a personal portfolio designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Front-End Developer.

It allows you to browse my previous work, explore the technologies I use, and download my resume directly. Additionally, the website provides an easy way to contact me via email.

Built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, the site features a modern, responsive design, enhanced with Framer Motion to create smooth and engaging animations for an improved user experience.
